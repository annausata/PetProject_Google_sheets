## E-Commerce Shipping Data Analysis

This project explores an e-commerce dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prachi13/customer-analytics), which contains information about customer orders, shipping methods, warehouses, ratings, and delivery performance.

The goal was to analyze key delivery and customer experience indicators using **Google Sheets**, supported by dashboards and visual summaries.

## 📁 Project Structure

- [📊 Google Sheets Workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pRwFUKf0eVppsS8nrZUEurLy14cmHHz_22117oecJ4Y/edit?usp=sharing) – contains raw data, dashboards, calculations, and final conclusion
- `META` – metadata and column descriptions
- `Conclusion` – final interpretation and observations from the analysis

## 📊 Dashboards Overview

I created 5 mini dashboards based on the following analytical questions:

### 1. General Overview
- What is the average cost of a product?  
- What is the average customer rating?  
- What percentage of products were not delivered on time?

### 2. Shipping Mode Analysis
- Which mode of shipment is used most often?  
- Is there a relationship between the mode of shipment and on-time delivery?  
- What is the average customer rating per shipping method?

### 3. Warehouse Analysis
- Which warehouse block handles the most orders?  
- Which warehouse block has the highest late delivery rate?

### 4. Customer Ratings
- Do dissatisfied customers (ratings 1–2) receive late deliveries more often?  
- What is the average rating per warehouse or shipment mode?

### 5. Product Importance
- Are high-importance products more likely to be delivered on time?  
- What is the average customer rating per product importance level?

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Google Sheets** – for data cleaning, pivot tables, charts, and dashboards  
- **CSV** – used to store metadata  
- **Video Tutorial** – I followed a [Google Sheets data project video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYjQRW6N6Ws&t=7401s), where I learned about the key steps in spreadsheet-based data analysis: from importing data to building dashboards.

As part of this learning, I decided to create my own mini project using a real dataset. I followed similar stages as presented in the video, including:

- ✅ Choosing an idea  
- ✅ Data collection  
- ✅ Data preparation and transformation  
- ✅ Exploratory analysis using pivot tables and charts  
- ✅ Dashboard creation  
- ✅ Publishing the results on GitHub
